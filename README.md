# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors” that prompts the user to play five times in a row before revealing the results. For the moment, the game can only be played from the browser console, but a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text will be added later. 

The console will prompt you to enter your choice of either rock, paper, or scissors five times as the computer's choice is randomly selected. A score will be kept and the final result will be shown at the end
